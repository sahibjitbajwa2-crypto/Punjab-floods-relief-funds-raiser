# Punjab-floods-relief-funds-raiser
The catastrophic floods in Punjab have left thousands of families homeless, hungry, and in desperate need of help. Homes have been washed away, crops destroyed, and access to clean water and medical care is scarce. Sarhadi People Welfare Society is working tirelessly to provide immediate relief to these communities.
